Maze text files must have the width (x-axis) and length (y-axis) of the text file marked on the first line of the file.  If the maze has a width of 10 and a length of 5 maze then the first line should read "10 5". The maze must start on the second line. The walls of the maze must be marked by asterisks (*), and the path of the maze must be marked by periods (.). The maze cannot have any cycles in it. The path must start on the first line of the maze and end on the last line of the maze. Change the file path in mazerunner.cpp to the file path of your maze.
